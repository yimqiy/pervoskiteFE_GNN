## SP3275 Science for a Sustainable Earth

[SP3275](https://nus-sps.github.io/modules.sp3275/) is an interdisciplinary course under NUS [Special Programme in Science](https://sps.nus.edu.sg/academic-programme/), consisting of modelling of scientific phenomena and data analysis components applied to a fieldwork setting. More to come!

This work is the product of me and my group: Deborah, Eric and Jun Yuan from the batch of 22/23.
