[SP3275]([url](https://nus-sps.github.io/modules.sp3275/)) is an interdisciplinary course under NUS [Special Programme in Science]([url](https://sps.nus.edu.sg/academic-programme/)), consisting of modelling of scientific phenomena and data analysis components applied to a fieldwork setting. More to come!

This work is the product of me and my group: Deborah, Eric and Jun Yuan from the batch of 22/23.
